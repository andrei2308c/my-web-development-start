# My Web Development Journey ðŸš€

## ðŸŒŸ About This Repository
This repository showcases all the small projects I worked on while building my web development skills. In the **beginning of my career**, I used **GitLab** (you can check my previous projects here: https://gitlab.com/andreichirea/myprojects ).

Now, I am focusing on **GitHub** and expanding my expertise in web development. This repo is a collection of early projects that helped me gain experience with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more**.

## ðŸ”— My GitLab Journey
- I initially worked with **GitLab**, and you can explore my past projects here:
